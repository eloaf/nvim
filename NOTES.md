Ideas:
- powerbar should show keyboard inputs, or at least keystrokes in normal or visual mode
- Create menus for each plugin like NvimTree, Telescope, Cmp, etc that shows default and remapped keymappings
- What I really want is maybe just a telescope list I create myself to the help documents of each plugin?
