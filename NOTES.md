Ideas:
- powerbar should show keyboard inputs, or at least keystrokes in normal or visual mode
- Create menus for each plugin like NvimTree, Telescope, Cmp, etc that shows default and remapped keymappings
- What I really want is maybe just a telescope list I create myself to the help documents of each plugin?
- Fix nerdcommenter to ignore blank / whitespace lines
- Better nerdcommenter mappings
- What's Previous/Next edited buffer? Seen buffer?
- When dedenting in insert mode, but then hitting <CR>, it re-indents
- Telescope for LSP "gotos"
- autopairs seems to not overwrite the closing bracket now?
